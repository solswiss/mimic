            For the purpose of fulfilling the requirements of Hackclub's Swirl, I went digging and procured a list of obscure HTML elements to use in this project! That includes...
            <ul>
                <li><code class="html">&lt;mark&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;</code> used, in general, to display the colors of items</li>
                <li><code class="html">&lt;details&gt;[hidden stuff] ... &lt;summary&gt;[toggle title]&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/details&gt;</code> for the vendors - clean, right?</li>
                <li><code class="html">&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> for color selection! how fun :D</li>
                <li>If you're wondering how this displays HTML as plaintext, the trick is to replace angle brackets with their corresponding HTML entities;
                    &amp;lt; (also &amp;#60;) is the less than symbol and &amp;gt; (also &amp;#62;) is the greater than symbol. Wanna know more? Use the inspect tool!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="timed">Nearly lost my mind over CSS animations (I forgot how to do things...)</div>
        <div class="timed">Had the ingenious idea to make this timeline! Also realized how this was meant to be more or less a throwaway project (shhhh don't tell the website!) and it's taken the spot of my own portfolio ww</div>
        <div class="timed">I think I had a breakthrough in the design of this website's owner last night!!! In English, its name is Mong, nickname MongMong :D More to come in due time ^^</div>
        <div class="timed">Browsed my liked songs list (Spotify) (my Youtube collection is honestly better but I don't have much patience ww) to make the music selection section! Unfortunately?, I am the type to refresh my liked songs every now and then and I might have to do some extended Spring Cleaning soon.</div>
