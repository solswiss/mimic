            <h1>stationery</h1>
            <p>Let me tell you something. 
                I don't have a lot of stationery mostly 
                because I don't often use stationery in the first place. 
                I am, nevertheless, a stationery enjoyer from afar. 
                Should I write a list of items I want? 
                No. that would take far too long.</p>
